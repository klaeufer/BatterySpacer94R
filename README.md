# Overview

3d CAD model for a battery spacer to allow installing a group 94R battery in place of a 24F or 27F one.

# Motivation

Why go with a 94R instead of the OEM group sizes 24F or 27F? 

- 94R is widely available as an AGM battery *and much more affordable* compared to 27F.
- In terms of capacity, it is a significant upgrade over 24F and comes close to 27F.
- It has the same size footprint as 27F and therefore fits in the battery compartment of the 4th-gen Toyota 4Runner (N210).

# Status

- 3d Model complete.
- Printing of prototype pending.

# Battery sizes

## Capacity and Length/width/height:

- Group 24F (65Ah):          282     168     229
- Group 27F (92Ah):          318     173     227
- Group 94R (H7/L4) (80Ah):  315     175     190

## Additional group 94R dimensions

- 121 mm battery width upper
- 12 mm wide and 5 mm deep gap for folding handles across width of battery 
- 25 mm step height between outer and inner top of battery 

## Dimensions of hold-down bar

- 45 mm width
- 8 mm height center
- 12 mm height ends
- 175 mm inside length; spacer needs to fit in there lengthwise
